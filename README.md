# Java Basics Learning Project: Console Hangman Game

This project is part of my personal journey to learn the basics of Java programming through my training with
[Dyma](https://dyma.fr/java).

It features a simple console-based Hangman game, which helps me practice essential Java concepts such as variables,
control structures, loops, and basic I/O operations.
